Notes on getting started with TODO LIST project.

- I want to use constructor/classes for an OOP style as opposed to functional style, for todo object creation.

- My todo list items should contain properties for:
    title
    description
    dueDate
    priority
    *optional: notes
    *optional: checklist
    *optional: subtasks

- I want "projects" that each group their own todo lists.

- Users can create projects, todos, assign todos to projects. There must be a default project if none is selected.

- Need separate modules for application logic and DOM manipulation.

- UI minimum requirements:
    - View all projects.
    - View all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate… perhaps changing color for different priorities).
    - Expand a single todo to see/edit its details.
    - Delete a todo.

- Install webpack and date-fns (for formatting and manipulating date/time)

- Created projects and todos must be stored in localStorage.
    - Function to save projects and todos every time one is created.
    - Function to look for that data in localStorage when the app is first loaded.
    - Ensure the app doesn't crash if looking for data fails (need a fallback).
    - To inspect saved data in localStorage in devtools, go to Application tab > Storage > Local Storage.
    - localStorage uses JSON to send, store and retrieve data. JSON can't store functions, so how will I add methods to my object properties once I fetch them? 

Draft of website structure

    I want a sidebar with nav.

    Each task is assigned to a project. Either the default project or a user-created 
    project but clicking on that project in the task card opens a dropdown menu
    allowing the user to change the project it's assigned to.

    Each task card has a little delete button in the bottom right corner
